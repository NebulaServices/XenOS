## Developing XenOS
### Dependencies
- NodeJS
- NPM (PNPM is **strongly** recommended)
- Git
- `uuidgen`

Currently XenOS supports building on Windows, but we cannot promise compatibility forever. We recommended using WSL
### Instructions
First, clone the repo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nebulaservices/xenos.git --recursive
$ cd xenos
```
Install dependencies
```sh
pnpm i # Or npm i
```
To start the dev server
```sh
# If you are on Linux, MacOS, or some other UNIX-like OS:
pnpm dev # or npm run build

# If you are on Windows, or are just a weirdo who enjoys Powershell
pnpm dev:windows # or npm run build:windows
```
To build
```sh
# Same spiel as above
pnpm build
pnpm build:windows
```
To serve the build
```sh
pnpm start # or npm start
```
